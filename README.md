## Facebook use in Affective Disorders

A platform for subjects to self-report their mood on a daily basis.  Serves 
a secondary purpose to gain access to a subject's Facebook feed for machine 
learning purposes.

### Mood reporting
Subjects can fill out a daily survey based around their mood.

### Log in with Facebook
When subjects log in with Facebook, they give the application permission to,
access their Facebook feed.  Through this, we can collect data to analyse.

### Admin
Particular users flagged as adminstrators can gain access to view backend
information about the subjects.  In particular: mood overview, frequency of 
use etc...

### Privacy
Subject's personalised data is not stored anywhere in this application.  We 
store their Facebook id and access token and responses.
